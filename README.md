## Questions:

1.  How do the stem plots of the four different FIR filters compare?  How are the filters similar and how are they different?

2.  How are the frequency responses similar and different?  How do they compare in the pass band and stop band?

4.  How much delay are you seeing in your filtered signal compared to the original?

5.  How much time does the circular convolution filtering take compared to your original implementation?

6.  Given the sampling rate and filter length, how much of a penalty is it to use a longer FIR filter compared to an IIR filter in real-world applications?
